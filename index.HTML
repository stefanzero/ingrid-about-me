<h1>Welcome!<h1>
    <p>My name is Ingrid Lopez, <br>
        I am 20 years old </p>
        <br>
        <br>
<p>I am currently studying to become a software developer. <br>
    I have been passionate about technology and coding,<br>
    which is why I decided to pursue this career path.<br> 
    In my free time, I enjoy hiking, running<br>
     and experimenting with new programming languages.<br>
     My goal is to work for a tech company<br>
     where I can contribute to innovative projects <br>
     and continue to grow my skills as a developer.</p>
