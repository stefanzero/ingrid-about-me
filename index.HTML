     <label for="bio">Your Bio:</label><br>
  <textarea id="bio" class="bio-box" placeholder="Ingrid Lopez was born in Honduras. She was raised in a small town in southern Honduras by her grandmother, Maria Lopez,<br> and her aunt, Guadalupe Amaya, alongside her sister, Yenifer Torres. She attended Escuela Republica de Argentina,<br> where  with her dedication earned her a scholarship in third grade. This opportunity sparked her dream of attending a university in the future.<br> <br>In 2016, when she was in the 8th grade, Ingrid’s life took a major turn, at just 13 years old, Ingrid moved to USA,<br> she was nervous about the unknown challenges ahead, but she courageously began her journey.<br> When she arrived in San Francisco, Ingrid was determined to continue her education. However, she did not know English,<br>  as she grew up speaking Spanish and did not have access to English classes in Honduras. Despite this challenge, she enrolled<br> at Mission High School and worked hard to learn the language. She later attended San Francisco State University,<br> where she earned her Bachelor’s Degree in Criminal Justice Studies with a minor in Juvenile Justice.<br> 
While pursuing her degree, Ingrid worked part-time at Instituto Familiar de la Raza. <br> In her final year of university, she also completed a fellowship with College Corps,<br>  serving as a tutor for the JCYC program at James Denman Middle School.<br>  On weekends, she remained active in her church community. Throughout the years,<br>  Ingrid has been involved in the San Francisco community and has participated in <br> leadership workshops provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health.<br> <br> 
Ingrid enjoys staying active and productive. She runs around Lake Merced 3–5 times a week,<br>  listens to music, plays soccer, and enjoys socializing. She considers herself successful because <br> she has overcome challenges she once thought were impossible, //*like graduating from a university*//<br>  despite financial and language barriers. Her accomplishments are a source of pride for both herself and her family.<br> 
Ingrid is now pursuing a career in the justice system to serve her community in San Francisco.<br>  She is especially interested in working within the justice system because she believes in second chances<br>  and the power of guidance and rehabilitation. She values accountability, fairness,<br>  and community safety—principles that align with the mission of the department.<br>  Ingrid is passionate, hardworking, and eager to continue learning. <br> She brings strong communication skills, leadership experience, public speaking ability,<br>  critical thinking, and time management to everything she does. <br> She is ready to be a positive influence and create change in her community."></textarea>
